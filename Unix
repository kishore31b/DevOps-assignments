What is the difference between login shell and non-login shell?
login shell:- If you open a shell or terminal (or switch to one), and it asks you to log in (Username? Password?) before it gives you a prompt, it's a login shell.
non-login shell:- If it doesn't (like gnome-terminal), and lets you use it straight away, it's a non-login shell.

How do we start login shell and non-login shell?
Log in as a user, edit your .bash_profile. Add a variable called MYFULLNAME as follows:

MYFULLNAME="kk"

Save the file and logout.

Now login again.

Type the following at the prompt:

echo $MYFULLNAME
What happens? Why?

Now type bash again. In the new shell that open type the following:

echo $MYFULLNAME
What happens? Why?

Start another "bash" shell

In it type;

echo $MYFULLNAME
What happens? Why?

Edit your .bashrc, adding this:

MY_FAV_MOVIE="Finding Nemo"
Save the file and log out, log in again then type the following at your prompt:

echo $MY_FAV_MOVIE
echo $MYFULLNAME
                        
What happens? Why?

Type bash;

echo $MY_FAV_MOVIE
echo $MYFULLNAME
                        
What happens? Why?

Type bash;

echo $MY_FAV_MOVIE
echo $MYFULLNAME
